# Time Series Forecasting using R
Due to the rising temperatures in Malaysia in recent years, it is important for the Malaysian
government to have a forecasting method that accurately predicts future temperatures so that the
Malaysian government can take the correct/necessary actions to ensure the safety of everyone in
Malaysia. In order to achieve that goal, we have devised several objectives:

1. To visualise the time series dataset to comprehend past years temperature readings.
2. To study how the temperature in Malaysia progresses/changes as the years go by (pattern)
   and identify any predictable or regular changes that occur yearly.
3. To model the problem using several different **Time Series Models**, which are **SARIMA**, **AUTO ARIMA**, **ETS**
   and **Multiplicative Holt-Winters**, evaluate them based on certain evaluation metrics and choose the
   forecasting model that is the best at forecasting temperatures in Malaysia.
4. To warn/alert the Malaysian government ahead of time about the times where the temperatures in Malaysia
   would be extremely high so that the ministers are given more time to formulate solutions or plans to
   confront the issue, such as an incoming heatwave.
5. To raise public awareness by making temperature forecasts publicly available so that people can support
   policies that combat climate change and make informed decisions in their day-to-day lives. Examples are
   using public transportation, promoting afforestation and reforestation or using renewable energy. These
   actions can help to reduce carbon emissions.

We have provided the dataset used for this assignment as well as the documentation. The source code can be found in the
last few pages of the report.

Happy reading! ðŸ˜€
